Overview
========
The data-structure drawer (dsd) is an XBlock created by Trinity University for the Edx platform (TrinityX). 

Development
===========
* ``git clone https://github.com/TrinityUniversity/dsd``
* Install the `xblock-sdk <https://github.com/edx/xblock-sdk>`_ (with virtualenv)
* ``pip install dsd``

Now the dsd XBlock will be available at `127.0.0.1:8000 <http://127.0.0.1:8000>`_. After you've made changes to dsd you'll need to update the virtualenv ``pip install dsd --upgrade``
