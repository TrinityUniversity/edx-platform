Documentation

The built documentation is available online at http://trinityx.readthedocs.org

Overview
========
The documentation is generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and written in `reStructured Text <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_

Updating
========
All the documentation is located in the ``docs/`` directory. Once you've made your changes and contributions, you can test your changes by building the docs locally (via the devstack)::

    sudo su edxapp
    cd /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/docs
    make html

Now in your host, using your favorite webbrowser open ``/edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/docs/build/html/index.html``

Deploying
=========
Any changes to ``docs/`` pushed to master will automatically get rebuilt by readthedocs.
